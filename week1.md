# Embedded System Design with MCU and FPGA
* Wed. afternoon in CM600
* HW and Labs: 70%
* Term project: 30%

## Embedded System Design Platform
#### Software Tool
* computer
    
* embedded systems
    * locater: before downloading file to memory, it needs to figure out the location
    * after linking and locating, it will generate executable files

#### Homework
* 週五前繳交
* lab01_系所_學號_名字
* Q1. Where is the main()?
* Q2. What is the name of the cross compuler?
    * avr-g++
    * avr-gcc
* Q3. Where is the location of the cross compiler?
    * /private/var/folders/3m/5t7nmw9x071cj603r6lwdld80000gn/T/AppTranslocation/23297013-0211-4D79-994D-9059AD9ADCB9/d/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/bin/avr-g++
    * /private/var/folders/3m/5t7nmw9x071cj603r6lwdld80000gn/T/AppTranslocation/23297013-0211-4D79-994D-9059AD9ADCB9/d/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/bin/avr-gcc
* Bonus: How do you use the cross compiler without using Arduino IDE?
* Bonus: Memory configration file
